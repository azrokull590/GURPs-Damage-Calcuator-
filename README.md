# GURPs-Damage-Calcuator-
Personal project to make a damage calculator for GURPs 4e


The purpose of this program is so add characters, keep track of their health in combat, and then calcuate damage they deal and take. Current features are add characters, delete characters, and damage calcuations and a GUI. I plan to add save/load functions, character editing, equipment changes, and more options from the tabletop rpg. The wiki contains infromation how the program works
